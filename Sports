The Return Of King

India Celebrated Diwali a day before because of the amazing victory of team India over Pakistan. India had won the toss and elected to ball first. Our ballers performed too good enough for us to have a decent target of  160 runs.
Although it was an easy target because we lost some early wickets of our openers the target was not difficult to achieve.
Then Virat Kohli came to bat and the picture completely changed. On the win predictor, India had only a 15% chance to win the game and 85% Pakistan.
But Kohli took responsibility and we won this important match.
